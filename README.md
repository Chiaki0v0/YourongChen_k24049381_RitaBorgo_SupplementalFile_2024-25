This supplementary package provides the datasets, code, and prototype scenes referenced in the paper.

1. The files **AllStarsClub.zip, audio.mp3, and mNFT2.jpg** are used as input data for **code.ipynb**, which implements the experimental pipeline including transformer-based multimodal embedding, generation of multi-modal NFTs (mNFTs) in JSON format, and evaluation procedures. 
2. **PrototypeScene.zip** corresponds to Section 8.1 of the paper, presenting a prototype VR scene rebuilt via the transformer approach, while **SCENE1-3.zip** corresponds to Section 8.2, illustrating the envisioned ideal outcomes of VR scene reconstruction across three scenarios.
